#Semaine 3 : Pairs

##Presentation :  
We had to do a pairs game using js/DOM.

##What's inside :  
__index.html__ : I used divs with background-color and background-image, h1 and h2 for dispaly,  
a replay button and divs for cardback choices.  
__main.css__ : Added a font, flex properties and some basic css declarations, nothing  
fancy (for a change).  
__main.js__ : used an array for bg-colors which is randomized when window is loaded or when replay  
button is clicked. Checking function only compares bg-colors of the 2 clicked cards. There's also  
a click lock to prevent clicking abuse and bugs resulting.

##How ?  
JS + DOM
